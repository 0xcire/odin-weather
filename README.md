# Weather App

Simple weather app for The Odin Project.

Implementing a gif for the project was fun, and it was good practice for async / await and promises, however, if I were to make my own weather app I would definitely do without.

But, more importantly I learned a lot more about async await chaining, how to read errors and et cetera.
